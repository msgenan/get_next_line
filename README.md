get_next_line is a project designed to implement a function that reads a line of text from a file descriptor. The goal of this project is to master the concept of buffered input and file reading,
specifically in situations where the input data may span multiple reads. This function reads a file (or standard input) one line at a time, ensuring the reading is efficient and that each line is returned correctly.
